# Citi Bike Sharing
### Overview of the analysis
This is an analysis of NYC Citi Bike data in August 2019. We used Tablu, a data visualization tool, to explore the viability of a bike-sharing business in Des Moines.

### Results

This the the checkout times for customers between 0-2 hours. We can see that most people check out within an hour.

![Checkout Times by Gender](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/58046234/160258406-182aaa61-bcad-4b6f-8900-c3aec8de3516.png)
This the the checkout times for customers between 0-2 hours speperated by gender. We can see that males tend to use the Citi bikes more than females.

This is a heatmap of trips by weekday. We can see that most of the rides happen around 7 am to 9 am and 5 pm to 7 pm on week days. On weekends, we see that the bikes are used mostly between 11 am to 7 pm.

This is a heatmap of trips by weekday by gender. We can see that most of the rides are male and that they are our main customers, considering that it looks very similar to the original heatmap.

This is a heatmap between gender and weekday and type of user. We can see that subcribers mostly use the Citi bikes compared to customers. We also see that we mostly have subscibers using it, which means they are probably using the Citibikes as a dialy comute and are probably locals. We can also see that there are less customers, which means that tourists/visitors are using the bikes, but not as often. 

### Summary
The far majority of the rides were in the very busy Manhattan Island, taken by male users during morning and evening rush hours. This implies that Citi Bike services are used as an alternative to public transportation by commuting workers. 
We did take the data from August 2019, when the weather is decent and before the pandemic. However, we should test other months, like the witer months when it is very snowy and the summer months when it is very hot outside. We should also check the data now, after the pandemic and see if the bikes are still successful now.
